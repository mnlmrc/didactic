    "Throughout the tutorial, we use example fMRI data from an experiment in which participants responded to tactile stimuli on either the index or ring finger, following a visual cue that indicated the probability of stimulation for each finger. The visual cues were 0%-100% ring-index, 25%-75%, 50%-50%, 75%-25% or 100%-0%. To simplify, we will use condition labels only reporting the index probability, i.e., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. The data were collected in ten blocks. In the first-level GLM, we modelled neural activation $y_i$ in the $ i^{th} $ voxel as a linear combination of 5 regressors of interests, each corresponding to a probability cue:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_i = X \\beta_i + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\beta$ coefficients from each regressor indicate how much each voxel was activated for each probability cue. The goal of RSA is to understand whether voxels show different **activity patterns** between conditions, regardless of the overall amount of activation. Let's first load the data:"
